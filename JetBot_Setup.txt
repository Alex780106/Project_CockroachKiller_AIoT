Jetson nano 2GB JetBot AI kit

Step.1 HardWare Setup

Reference:
https://www.waveshare.net/wiki/JetBot_AI_Kit



Step.2-1 SoftWare Setup(Image file)
1. Download the image `jetbot-043_nano-2gb-jp45.zip` (the latest version) from NVIDIA-AI-IOT GitHub
   Reference: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/releases
2. Flash the zip file to the SD card (recommend over 64 GB)
3. Insert the SD card in the jetson nano SD card slot
4. Turn on the power and jump to Step 3 to set up WIFI


Step.2-2 SoftWare Setup(Docker)
NOTE.1: This method is suitable for your jetson nano has already installed JetPack.

NOTE.2: If you set up JetBot using the pre-built JetBot docker containers, 
        you should check whether the JetPack version is compatible with the JetBot version first.
        Reference: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/releases

* JetPack 4.5(L4T R32.5.0)
Container Version v2.0.1-r32.5.0

* JetBot 0.4.3

l4t-pytorch:r32.5.0-pth1.6-py3
- PyTorch v1.6.0
- torchvision v0.7.0
- torchaudio v0.6.0


Follow by the steps described below:
$ git clone http://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot.git

$ cd jetbot
$ ./scripts/configure_jetson.sh
$ ./scripts/enable_swap.sh

$ cd docker
$ ./enable.sh $HOME



Step.3 WIFI Setup

First-time Setup
1. Plug in USB-C/micro-USB cable to connect your laptop and JetBot
2. Confirm that the laptop can read the files in the JetBot
3. Open MobaXterm to build a session
   >>> SSH -> Remote host -> 192.168.55.1
   >>> Enter the username and the password
4. $ sudo nmcli device wifi rescan
5. $ sudo nmcli device wifi list
6. $ sudo nmcli device wifi connect <wifi_name> password <wifi_password>
7. OLED will show the <jetbot_ip>
8. Remove the USB-C/micro-USB cable
9. Go to https://<jetbot_ip>:8888 from a web browser and start programming JetBot


Second-time Setup if JetBot lost the connection of the original wifi connection:
Method.1
1. Plug in USB-C/micro-USB cable to connect your laptop and JetBot
2. Confirm that the laptop can read the files in the JetBot
3. Open MobaXterm to build a session
   >>> SSH 192.168.55.1
4. $ sudo nmcli device wifi rescan
5. $ sudo nmcli device wifi list
6. $ sudo nmcli device wifi connect <wifi_name> password <wifi_password>
7. OLED will show the <jetbot_ip>
8. Remove the USB-C/micro-USB cable
9. Go to https://<jetbot_ip>:8888 from a web browser and start programming JetBot

Method.2
1. Plug in USB-C/micro-USB cable to connect your laptop and JetBot
2. Confirm that the laptop can read the files in the JetBot
3. Go to https://192.168.55.1:8888 from a web browser (Password: jetbot)
4. Open a terminal
   # If you're in the jetbot container, do the step 5, else jump to step 6
5. ssh nano@0.0.0.0  # ssh login to jetson localhost from jupyterlab terminal
6. $ sudo nmcli device wifi rescan
7. $ sudo nmcli device wifi list
8. $ sudo nmcli device wifi connect <wifi_name> password <wifi_password>
9. OLED will show the <jetbot_ip>
10. Remove the USB-C/micro-USB cable
11. Go to https://<jetbot_ip>:8888 from a web browser and start programming JetBot
